# Module-19-Challenge
## Description
In this assignment I will be creating an application to hire fintech professionals. I will also be able to display each individual in a drop down menu list and choose how many hours to hire them for and send and make transactions with ether. Initially I will import a ethereum transaction within the application and then sign said transaction.
## Testing Transaction
Provided below are screenshots of the application and the ganache transactions made which were verified. 
Here I hire Lane for a set number of hours, it updates the wage based on the hours I want to hire Lane for and after sending the transaction you can see the validated hash.

This transaction can actually be viewed in Ganache, it will show the address, balance and the transaction itself. This account started with 100 ether and as shown in the screenshot above, it should take away 20 ether and have 80  ether remaining in the account. This is exactly what is shown below.
