# Module-19-Challenge
## Description
In this assignment I will be creating an application to hire fintech professionals. I will also be able to display each individual in a drop down menu list and choose how many hours to hire them for and send and make transactions with ether. Initially I will import a ethereum transaction within the application and then sign said transaction.
## Testing Transaction
Provided below are screenshots of the application and the ganache transactions made which were verified. 
Here I hire Lane for a set number of hours, it updates the wage based on the hours I want to hire Lane for and after sending the transaction you can see the validated hash.
